# Implementation-of-K-Means-Clustering-for-Customer-Segmentation

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import pandas and matplot libraries.

2.import Kmeans algorithm to solve customer segmentation.

3.Using the for loop cluster the given data

4.Predict the output and plot data graphs.

5.Display the outputs
